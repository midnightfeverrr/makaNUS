# makaNUS

Team Name : No Errors

Proposed Level of Achievement : Apollo 11

## Motivation
It is inevitable to become burned out during your studies at National University of Singapore. After a long day of classes, the only thing you want is just to find some good food to revive your spirits! But, where should you eat? 

Some of us may have difficulties finding somewhere to eat around NUS. For students who live on campus, they may probably feel bored with their day-to-day meals from their hostels or halls. Meanwhile, students who stay off campus are mostly unfamiliar with places to eat in campus. Google and other available applications may not help since school’s hawker stalls are not fully registered in majority. With this new NUS application, people can find new places to fulfil their hunger, even hidden gems in NUS they never knew existed before! 

In addition, there are fewer reviews on the food around campus. After attending numerous classes and finishing loads of assignments, definitely we refuse to have an unpleasant food. Most of us, especially freshies, are not sure what food is suitable, and what food is not, as well as what suits our taste. The app features a section with food reviews and comments, so we don't need to worry about trying new foods.

## User Stories
1. As the people of NUS, I want to know what foods are there that I haven’t tried yet, to have various kinds of foods to eat, and not repeating foods daily.
2. As the people of NUS, I want to know how the food tastes like before trying it, so I want to read the comments of people who already ate there.
3. As the people of NUS, we don’t just want to know what to eat, but what is available near me. 
4. As the people of NUS, we want to know the prices of the food. So, we can sort the food stalls according to the cost.
5. As the people of public, we want to know where to eat good food in NUS.
6. As the people of public, we want to know the direction leading to the food stalls.

## Aim
makaNUS is meant to be an exclusive NUS food guide and service. The main features of makaNUS will be to provide comments and ratings about the food stalls as well as information about nearby food stalls and their locations. By using makaNUS, we aim to enhance the dining experience for everyone in NUS locals. In addition, to make this app even more interesting, we are implementing an account levelling system, a system that grants various rewards as you level up, by doing the to-do lists!

## Problems Encountered 
1. "expo-app-loading is deprecated in favor of expo-splash-screen" pops up when application is first ran because we are using AppLoading instead of SplashScreen. 
How we plan to handle: Use splashscreen for loading.
2. Sign in with Google does not work in Login screen. It is said that auth is not supported in the environment.
How we plan to handle: More research to fix the problem.
